* Project Goals
As stated in the README, the curation process has five steps:
1. data aggregation
2. sanitization - removal of mixtures, inorganic compounds, and salts
3. standardization of structures
4. removal of duplicates
5. manual review

Want to make a program that is modular, so that you can load just the structure
standardization piece (for example) and work with that in a Jupyter
notebook. Need to repackage for this.

Also want to bundle a commandline interface that will take in a file or a list
of files are perform all steps end-to-end, outputting the cleaned results and a
list of compounds requiring manual review.

Want to support a good range of file types.

Definitely need to have good test coverage for a project like this.

* Flow of current program

* Dependencies
Libraries used in this project:
- The [[https://www.rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html][RDKit]], an open-source toolkit for cheminformatics.
- [[https://molvs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][MolVS]], a molecule validation and standardization tool built using RDKit
- [[https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/][Pandas]], for the majority of the dataset manipulation
- [[https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/][Click]], the "command line interface creation kit", for creating the cli tool

* Tasks for 0.1.0 [4/9]
** DONE Set up `conda-build` build process

  It works! I don't know why, but conda-build and conda-install are now working.
  Steps taken:
  + added "conda-forge" and "local" to channels in .condarc. Don't know if this
    one actually made a difference.
  + set channel_priority to strict in .condarc. Pretty sure this didn't change
    anything either.
  + commented out "rdkit" and "molvs" in setup.py. I think what happends is
    these packages are only found in conda-forge and somehow conda and
    setuptools are not syncing up when they look for the packages and so conda
    thinks setuptools is trying to install something else.

  Pip works just fine in the conda environment and the click/setuptools
  integration is working well too.
  
  #+begin_src sh
    pip install --editable .
  #+end_src

  One problem with not using conda is that I believe RDKit is olnly available
  from conda-forge, so pip would have to be told where to find it.

  This is kind of working.
  
  On my system (running Fedora 32), I installed conda from the RPM repo
  
  #+begin_src sh
    sudo dnf install conda
  #+end_src
  
  This gave me conda 4.8.2
  
  I set conda to install things to my $HOME directory.
  
  #+begin_src sh
    conda config --prepend pkgs_dirs ~/.conda/pkgs
    conda config --prepend envs_dirs ~/.conda/envs
  #+end_src
  
  I had to create a new environment because I was getting errors when trying to
  install packages to the base environment.
  
  #+begin_src sh
    conda create --name test_env
    conda activate test_env
  #+end_src
  
  Installed ~conda-build~
  
  #+begin_src sh
    conda install conda-build
  #+end_src
  
  Not sure if ~-c conda-forge~ should be used for all package installs - I have
  read a few SO answers that suggest that installing from differnet channels can
  cuase errors.
  
  And then from the project root, I ran ~conda-build~
  
  #+begin_src sh
    conda-build .
  #+end_src
  
  This failed, complaining that "RuntimeError: Setuptools downloading is disabled
  in conda build. Be sure to add all dependencies in the meta.yaml". I find this
  odd, since the official documentation AND the [[https://github.com/conda/cookiecutter-conda-python][conda-cookiecutter]] template use
  the ~install_requires~ field in setup.py. I couldn't find anything online
  documentating a change in behavior, although I did find a few GitHub issues of
  people experiencing similar errors and receiving no responses.
  
  ~Conda-build~ also wanted ~conda-verify~, so I installed that as well.
  
  Once I had ~conda-build~ running successfully, the next problem was ~conda
  install~. The documentation for building a conda package says to run
  ~conda-build~ and follow it up with
  
  #+begin_src sh
    conda install --use-local package_name
  #+end_src
  
  But ~conda install~ didn't give a shit where I told it to look (~-c local~ also
  did not work), and instead looked for ~chemical_suration~ in the official
  Anaconda repo. I finally got it installed by grabbing the install location from
  the end of the ~conda-build~ output and using ~--offline~, which looked like
  
  #+begin_src sh
    conda install --offline ~/.conda/envs/test_env/conda-bld/linux-64/chemical_curation-0.0.1-py37_0.tar.bz2
  #+end_src
  
  So then I was able to use ~from chemical_curation import curate~ to import
  everything from ~curate.py~ in a Python program. However, this didn't work at
  first since the environment didn't have rdkit installed. I thought the build
  process would bundle all the necessary libraries? It seems to have bundled
  everything else.
  
  I'm also confused as to how to get the CLI working once a package has been
  installed from using conda. Right now I only seem to be able to use the CLI from
  tbv.py if I run 
  
  #+begin_src sh
    python tbv.py ...
  #+end_src
  
  and tbv.py includes a ~if __name__=='__main__':~ block.
  
  Maybe the answer for right now is to use pip instead of conda, but I feel like
  since most people are probably using Anaconda, out package would be more
  accessible if we published it using conda and the associated package repos.

** DONE Remove hard-coded links in curate.py
CLOSED: [2020-05-11 Mon 23:43]

** TODO Create CLI
Thinking of calling the program `tbv`

*** DONE Get first working example
CLOSED: [2020-05-11 Mon 16:57]
Want to have an executable that takes in a filename or list of filenames and
executes the entire curation process as currently defined in curate.py.

#+begin_src sh
  tbv curate filename1 filename2 ...
#+end_src

*** DONE Add option to specify output location
CLOSED: [2020-05-11 Mon 16:57]
#+begin_src sh
  tbv curate -o output_dir filename1 filename2
#+end_src

*** TODO Add `verbose` options
How much logging do we output about what is going on?

#+begin_src sh
  tbv curate -v -o output_dir filename1 filename2
#+end_src

*** TODO Add commands for each module
Keep `curate` for running the full process

#+begin_src sh
  tbv curate [OPTIONS] filename1 filename2 ...
  tbv sanitize [OPTIONS] filename1 ...
  tbv standardize [OPTIONS] filename1 ...
  tbv dedup [OPTIONS] filename1 ...
#+end_src

** DONE Document build process in CONTRIBUTING.rst
CLOSED: [2020-05-11 Mon 23:59]
So it is reproducible and people can easily get the source to develop on.

** DONE Conda develop?
CLOSED: [2020-05-12 Tue 11:22]

  Apparently the answer is to use ~pip install --editable~, as ~conda develop~
  is not maintained and not documented. But pip can't deal with the dependecnies
  from conda-forge, I don't think. So we're left with the slower and more
  confusing process of conda-build and conda-install.

Pip has ~pip install --editable~. Conda seems to have some similar, ~conda
develop~, but there is scant information on how it works.

** TODO Add overview documentation

** TODO Add documentation for functions in curate.py

** TODO Refactor curate.py into individual modules

** TODO Add tests for modules

*** TODO Create testing setup
